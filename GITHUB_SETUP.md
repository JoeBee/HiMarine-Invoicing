# GitHub Repository Setup

## Step 1: Create the Repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Fill in the following:
   - **Repository name:** HiMarine-Invoicing
   - **Description:** Hi Marine Invoicing - Angular application for processing supplier XLSX files and generating invoices
   - **Visibility:** Choose Public or Private
   - **DO NOT** check "Initialize this repository with a README"
   - **DO NOT** add .gitignore or license (we already have these)

3. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push Your Code

Once the repository is created, run these commands:

```bash
cd C:\JB\GitHub\HiMarine-Invoicing
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/HiMarine-Invoicing.git
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## Alternative: If You Get Authentication Errors

If you get authentication errors, you may need to use a Personal Access Token:

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name like "HiMarine-Invoicing"
4. Select scopes: `repo` (all)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token (you won't see it again!)

Then push using:
```bash
git push https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/HiMarine-Invoicing.git main
```

Or configure git credential helper:
```bash
git config --global credential.helper store
git push -u origin main
# Enter your username and use the token as the password
```

## Current Git Status
